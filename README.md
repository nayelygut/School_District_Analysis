# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to remove grades of the 9th graders from Thomas High School, since the school board suspects there was some academic dishonesty. Once those grades were removed, I re-ran the school analysis to determine what impact the change would have on math, reading, and overall scores. 

## Results
- The district summary is affected by a slight drop in % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing. However, the drop is in the tenths place of the decimal.
- The school summary is affected in a similar fashion when looking at Thomas High School. The overall, reading, and math passing percentages drop in the tenths after removing the 9th graders from the analysis.
- The school performance is not affected, as Thomas remains on second place even after the adjustment in grades. 
- Consequences of replacing the ninth-grade scores:
	- Math and reading scores by grade were not affected.
	- In the scores by school spending we see a slight drop in the $630-644 range on % 	passing math, passing reading, and passing overall.
	- When looking at the scores by school size, there is a minimal drop for medium 	sized schools. 
	- Looking at scores by school type, the charter scores drop minimally.
## Summary
Although the scores were affected for the district summary, the school summary, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type, the drop was in the tenths and hundreds decimal places. If we rounded the numbers with no decimals, there was no difference in the scoring after 9th grader data was removed. The drop in scores was so minimal they would most likely not affect the budget decisions for the school board.
